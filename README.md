### ðŸŽ¯ Introduction
The objective of this coding challenge is to implement Amazon's pathfinding algorithm for Amazon's self-driving delivery vehicles. After lots of research and questions, I discovered that the required algorithm is similar to Paths in a Labyrinth â€“ Recursive Algorithm.

##### Note:
ðŸŸ¢ Completed phase 1. Line 27 - 83 was gotten from the reference below and I modified to get the required output.\
ðŸ”´ Didn't do Phase 2 and Bonus sections.
